# About

Hi! I’m Hanna 👋

I’m currently learning about artificial intelligence and deep learning through the FastAI course—and this blog is where I share what I’ve learned along the way.

This blog is part of a subject assignment, to help us understand the concepts better.

Here, you’ll find:

- My projects (like building a bear classifier 🐻)
- Reflections on key concepts (like why deep learning is so good at computer vision)
- Notes from the lessons
- Occasional experiments and fun side quests in AI

I’m especially interested in topics like image recognition and model interpretation.

Thanks for stopping by!
