Hi! I'm Hanna, and this blog is where I share everything I'm learning in the FastAI course - from image recognition to neural networks and beyond.

Here you'll find my notes, reflections, and experiments as I go through the FastAI deep learning course. Whether you're new to AI or just curious, I hope you find something helpful! ðŸ§¡ðŸ’›ðŸ’š
