# Why I’m Taking the FastAI Course
Hi, and welcome to my blog!

I’ve always been curious about how machines can learn from data—and how we, as humans, can teach them to do things like recognize images, generate text, or even make decisions. That curiosity led me to the FastAI course, which promises to make deep learning more accessible and practical.

In this blog, I’ll document my journey through the course. I’ll share:
- What I learn in each lesson
- Projects I build
- Challenges I run into (and how I solve them)
- Key concepts explained in a simple way

My goal is to not just understand deep learning better, but to actually use it - whether that’s for personal projects, research, or future work. Hopefully, this blog can also be useful for others who are curious about AI or just starting their own learning journey.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more posts!
